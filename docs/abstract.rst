Abstract
========

Cancer:
Cancer is a heterogenous disease, in simple terms no two cancers types or even subtypes are same. The genome is a complex interrelated dynamic system and genes do not act in isolation but in concert with other genes within or between pathways. 

Neuroblastomas:
Neuroblastoma (NBL)

The integration of genomics with functional analysis is important for the investigation of complexity of cell as a whole. For e.g. DNA copy number may impact the mRNA expression and thus the phenotype of a cancer cell which determines the outcome. By studying the relationships and interactions between various components involved in NBL, including DNA copy number, methylation patterns, mRNA expression along with clinical parameters like age, stage and survival, it is hoped that eventually we will have a more complete understanding of NBL which will lead to improved survival of patients. 

Application:
We present an application in R shiny that will help users – both in the wet lab and dry lab – to investigate the mechanisms by which genes may interact with each other. This tool will be one of the first ones dedicated for analysis and visualization of Neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples. Some applications that we have integrated are: gene-gene correlations, copy number-mRNA correlations, Kaplan meier plots, comparison of tumor with normal data etc.
